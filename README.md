## Description
Yelp is an application to recommend users of a variety of restaurants and comprehensive entertainment experience. All the users can make reviews of the experience they make and give out the scores/stars they think the restaurants or spots deserved. In this project, I only focus on the relationship between the reviews provided by users and the stars they give out.

Besdies, because of the large dataset, I only choose first 20000 rows to increase the executing time which is examine to be in the random order.
